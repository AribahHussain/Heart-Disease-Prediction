# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project builds a heart disease prediction model using patient health data. It applies Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers to predict disease presence. The models are trained on encoded and scaled features, evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC. Visuals enhance interpretability.
