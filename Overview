# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques. It uses patient health records and evaluates models based on their classification performance.

## ✅ Objective

To classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease (1) or not (0) using health-related features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- StandardScaler for feature normalization
- ROC, Confusion Matrix for evaluation

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes features like:
- Age, Gender, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure
- Categorical columns are encoded
- Target: `0 = No Disease`, `1 = Disease`

## 🔎 Methodology

1. Data loaded and checked for missing values.
2. Data visualization: histograms, countplot, and correlation heatmap.
3. Preprocessing: One-hot encoding + scaling.
4. Models trained: Logistic Regression & Decision Tree.
5. Evaluation using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

## 📈 Results

- Both models perform well in classification.
- ROC curves highlight prediction quality.
- Decision Tree offers interpretability; Logistic Regression provides a strong baseline.

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in early detection of heart disease. While not a replacement for medical diagnostics, it is useful for predictive screening.
